# Tic Tac Toe

This module includes two variations of the classic Tic Tac Toe game:


## Classic Mode

- Standard 3×3 grid.
- Two players take turns placing X and O.
- The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.


## Dynamic Mode

- Also uses a 3×3 grid.
- Each player has only **three active marks** on the board at a time.
- Instead of placing a fourth mark, the player **moves their oldest mark to a new position**.
